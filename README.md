## McDonald's Sentiment Analysis

Within this subsection, we delve into sentiment analysis specifically targeting reviews for McDonald's. The aim is to gauge public sentiment and understand the driving factors behind these sentiments.

### Doc2Vec and Neural Network

Here, we employ the Doc2Vec methodology to represent our text data, further using these embeddings to train a neural network model for sentiment classification. Dive into the code and notebooks to see the preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps in detail.

### TF-IDF and Machine Learning

In this segment, we focus on the application of the TF-IDF vectorization technique alongside various machine learning algorithms to analyze sentiment. Our experiments encompass multiple algorithms, notably RandomForest, SVM, and Ridge Classifier. Furthermore, we explore different analyzer techniques with TF-IDF, such as word, char, and a combination of word-char. After extensive testing, we determine the best combination that offers optimal performance in sentiment classification. To grasp a deeper understanding, please refer to the respective code and notebooks.
