## McDonald's Sentiment Analysis

Within this subsection, we delve into sentiment analysis specifically targeting reviews for McDonald's. The aim is to gauge public sentiment and understand the driving factors behind these sentiments.

### Doc2Vec and Neural Network

Here, we employ the Doc2Vec methodology to represent our text data, further using these embeddings to train a neural network model for sentiment classification. Dive into the code and notebooks to see the preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps in detail.
